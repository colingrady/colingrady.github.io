      <div>
        I once had random code hosted here that I'd written for some of
        the tools I used, but those are no longer present or relevant; this
        was the 2006 to 2009 timeframe. You can still find the code on the
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140212085224/https://colin.grady.us/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>
        if you're interested.
